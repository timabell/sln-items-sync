        # because tags in GITHUB cannot be something like "1.22.3" we have to prepend a "v" for version tags
        # but because a "v" is prepended, we have to remove that again to be able to use the version tag as the version for packaging and pushing the NuGet-package
        # the "//v/" basically tells that every "v" is replaced by an empty string. c.f.: https://stackoverflow.com/a/67290085/8242470
        # using the approach to generate the version in another job for others to use works better than doing that in a global variable, c.f.: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/45488
